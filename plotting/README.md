Julia has several plotting libraries...

1. Plots - Common high level plotter that can call underlying
   libraries like PyPlot, gr or others.
   Advantage : no code change needed when switching libraries.

2. PyPlot ( similar to python one , easy transition for users
   familiar with python one ).


I am showing one example for python and the rest are based
on Plots.
